				<h2>Using Drupal, 2nd Edition (for Drupal 7)</h2>

				<p><strong>Angela "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/24967">webchick</a>" Byron</strong> is an open source evangelist, and has been called a Drupal freak by those in the know. She got her start as a Google Summer of Code student in 2005 and since then, she has immersed herself in the Drupal community. Her work includes coding and reviewing patches, creating and contributing to modules and themes, testing and quality assurance efforts within the project, improving documentation, and providing user support on forums and IRC. Angela is on the Board of Directors for the Drupal Association, and helps drive community growth by leading initiatives to help get new contributors involved. She is a sought-after lecturer on many themes, especially the topic of women in Open Source.</p>

				<p><strong>Addison "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/65088">add1sun</a>" Berry</strong> has been involved with Drupal since 2006. She is Lullabot's Director of Education and the Product Manager for Drupalize.Me, our Drupal video training site. She also travels around the world, speaking at events from local high schools to major conferences like OSCON, working to improve Drupal and Open Source software.</p>

She is one of the co-authors for the O'Reilly book Using Drupal, published in 2008. In March 2009 she was awarded a Knight Foundation grant to improve Drupal documentation. In addition to her focus on coordinating documentation efforts she's provided core patches, maintains several contributed modules, and has been involved with the Drupal Dojo and the Google Highly Open Participation (GHOP) mentoring programs.</p>

				<h2>Using Drupal, 1st Edition (for Drupal 6)</h2>
				
				<p>Both Angela and Addison were co-authors for the first edition, as well as these other fine folks:</p>
				
				<p><strong>Nathan "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/35821">quicksketch</a>" Haug</strong> is one of the forefront user-interface developers in the Drupal project. His interest in combining design and software implementation led him to complete undergraduate degrees in both Visual Communications and Computer Science. Using these skills he developed significant UI improvements for the Drupal 6 release, including Drupal's drag-and-drop implementation and a framework for easy AJAX-like behaviors. Nathan is considered the leading JavaScript developer in the Drupal project. In 2007, he led a development team at SonyBMG to build a Drupal-based platform for community websites around each of SonyBMG's music artists. He spends much of his time working between popular contribute modules such as Fivestar and Webform, or working to improve functionality in Drupal core.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Jeff "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/16496">eaton</a>" Eaton</strong> has been building software for the Internet and desktop applications for over a decade. He's participated in projects ranging from web-portals for communities and nonprofits, to enterprise client-server applications for retail industries, to large-scale web applications for companies like Dow AgroSciences and the Chicago Board of Trade. In 2005, he began developing solutions based on the open-source Drupal content management framework. In the years since, he's become a core developer for the Drupal project, specializing in architecture and API development. In his capacity as a consultant for Lullabot Consulting, LLC, he's helped plan and build the software infrastructure for Drupal sites including MTVUK's music portal, SonyBMG's artist site platform, and Fast Company's groundbreaking business networking site.</p>
				
				<p>Passionate about both technology and teaching, <strong>James "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/1531">walkah</a>" Walker</strong> is Lullabot's Director of Education where he oversees the company's public workshops, seminars and private Drupal trainings. A leader in the Drupal community, James is a founding member of the non-profit Drupal Association and the Drupal security team. As a long time member of the Drupal community, James maintains over a dozen modules and has contributed countless patches to Drupal core. A long time believer in Open Source and Open Standards, James has spent years co-ordinating Drupal's involvement with other communities such as Jabber/XMPP and, most recently, OpenID. An engaging speaker, James is a frequently requested presenter at many types of technical conferences. His humorous and informative lectures have been among the most well-attended at DrupalCons, starting with the first - four years ago.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Jeff "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/17190">jjeff</a>" Robbins</strong> is co-founder and CEO of Lullabot. He worked at O'Reilly &amp; Associates as an illustrator and systems administrator as the world wide web came into being. He was involved in the early stages of the first commercial website, O'Reilly's Global Network Navigator, but left to start one of the first web design companies, Liquid Media, in 1993.</p>
				
				<p>Considered by many to be the voice of Drupal, Jeff hosts Lullabot's weekly Drupal podcast, the #1 Drupal podcast in the world. Additionally, he has contributed over 20 Drupal modules and themes.</p>
