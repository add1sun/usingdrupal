Name: Views Bulk Operations Module
Authors: Karim Ratib <karim dot ratib at open dash craft dot com>
Drupal: 6
********************************************************************
DESCRIPTION:

This module augments views by allowing bulk operations to be made on
the nodes displayed by a view. It does so by showing a checkbox in
front of each node, and adding a select box containing all available
actions and node operations found in the system. The chosen action
is applied on each selected node.

********************************************************************
USAGE:

After activating the views_bulk_operations module, Create a new (page) view
and select "Bulk Operations View" as the view type. You will see a view
form similar to that of admin/content/node.
